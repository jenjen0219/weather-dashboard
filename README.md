# Weather DashBoard - Server Side API

## Description
This program is a weather dashboard that allows users to view the weather for multiple cities so that they can plan their trips accordingly. It features dynamically updated HTML and CSS (that is manipulated with Bulma) using the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data for cities.

The user can search for a city and is presented with current and future weather conditions for up to five days for that city. The searched city is added to the search history and can be clicked on to view the current and future conditions again.

As of 5/4/23 there are a few bugs within the code that make the search history buttons appear twice and other logistical things, but aside from those errors I found myself having a great time getting this far! I had some amazing TA help and watched quite a few weather dashboard tutorials that finally completed the bigger picture for me.
